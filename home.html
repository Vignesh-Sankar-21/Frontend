        both designed and produced in India.</p>
    <p class="a10"> 5. Rejoining DRDO in 1982, Kalam planned the program that produced a number of successful missiles, whichhelped earn him the nickname
         <b>“Missile Man.”</b></p>
     <p class="a10">6. Among those successes was Agni, India’s first intermediate-range
        ballistic missile, which incorporated
        aspects of the SLV-III and was launched
        in 1989.<br></p>
        <p class="a10">7. He also played a
        pivotal organisational, technical,
        and political role in India's Pokhran-II

        the original nuclear test by India in 1974.</p>

        solidified India as a nuclear power and

        a less-developed to a developed society
        in 20 years. </p>
